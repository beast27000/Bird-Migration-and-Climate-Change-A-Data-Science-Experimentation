# Bird-Migration-and-Climate-Change-A-Data-Science-Experimentation
This project investigates the relationship between bird migration patterns and climate change using real-time data from eBird API and OpenWeather API. The project collects data on bird sightings, merges it with weather data, and performs exploratory analysis and machine learning modeling to study patterns.
